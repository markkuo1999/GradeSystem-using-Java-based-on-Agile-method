# GradeSystem-using-Java-based-on-Agile-method

This grading system (a grade system) reads the results of the whole class, including lab1, lab2, lab3, midterm exam, final exam, etc. The built-in weights for each grade are 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.3, 0.4, depending on The total grade is calculated by assigning points for users to input commands (command), query grades (grade) and ranking (rank), and update the assigned points (update weights) to recalculate the total grade. The system can handle three abnormal conditions: 1 ) The ID contains letters 2) The length of the ID is incorrect 3) No ID

Additionally, this grading system is developed with Agile method. We first write the user story and test case of the system, then we write the pseudo code and test code with Java Java JUnit. Finally, we finish the source code of the system and test it with our test code.
